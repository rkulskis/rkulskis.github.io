Hello! My name is Ross, I am a senior at Boston University studying
computer science. I'm in my final year of the BA/MS, so I will be completing
my master's along with my bachelor's in May of 2025.

I love operating systems, my favorite things to use are Emacs and C. I also
dabble in cloud engineering (e.g. Kubernetes, CI/CD). I will be
applying to PhD programs this fall and hope to become Dr. Ross in the near future!

Outside of computer science, I play the trumpet in the New Jazz Orchestra
around Cambridge, MA. I also have been a big brother in the Boston Big Brothers
Big Sisters program for the past year. I have a dog named Winnie (picture above),
and I'm a proud brother of Phi Kappa Tau.
