Hello! My name is Ross, and I'm a PhD student at Boston University
studying Computer Science with a focus in real-time operating systems
under the direction of professor [[https://www.cs.bu.edu/~richwest/][Richard West]].

I love operating systems, and my favorite things to use are Emacs and C. I
also dabble in cloud engineering (e.g. Kubernetes, CI/CD). Code should
"just work", and I build all of my projects with this in mind - as
well as the SOLID principles.

Outside of computer science, I play the trumpet, having performed in
the New Jazz Orchestra around Cambridge, MA. I also have been a big
brother in the Boston Big Brothers Big Sisters program since fall
2024, and I have a dog named Winnie (picture above).
