Hello! My name is Ross, and I'm a computer scientist. I love operating
systems, and my favorite things to use are Emacs and C. I dabble in
cloud engineering (e.g. Kubernetes, CI/CD, terraform). Code should
"just work", and I build all of my projects with this in mind.

I am writing a free online textbook called [[https://bitsofcs.com/][Bits of CS]] which aims to
(1) excite people about computer science and building things and (2)
help people exercise and develop their voice as opposed to using AI.

Outside of computer science, I play the trumpet, having performed in
the New Jazz Orchestra around Cambridge, MA. I also have been a big
brother in the Boston Big Brothers Big Sisters program since fall
2024, and I have a dog named Winnie (picture above).
