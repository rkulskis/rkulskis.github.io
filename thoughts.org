#+TITLE: Thought List

I have this here so I can write things down in emacs and see them on
my phone.

* Thoughts

 * Map RT-DDS functional framework to a philosophical way of
   presenting work, e.g. every doc has a ~#+INCLUDE~ for e.g.:
   * ~one_liner.org~
   * ~problem_statemenet.org~
   * ~solution_statement.org~
   * etc.
 * Prove through logic that everything can be done in RT-DDS
   (including O.S. stuff and interaction with existing APIs)
   * Next: prove that this significantly reduces LOC and increases
     flexibility e.g. because we don't have to worry about
     communication -> handled by the framework

* Leetcode Refresher Learnings

 * binary search for sorted range with some property with ==, <, >
   * e.g. can use for finding closest sqrt of $n$ in range $[1, n//2]$
 * memoization: iterate from origin to dest cell
