* Work experience
** Systems Researcher
   BU Student Researcher under Rich West
   07/2024 - Present
   - **RT-DDS**: Built a publisher-subscriber real-time data distribution
     service on the Quest real-time OS and tested with DSP at 44kHz or 25
     microseconds. Aiming to publish the paper for this in RTAS this fall.
     - RT-DDS is the only data distribution service on a real-time OS, meaning
       it can provide unparalleled timing and predictability guarantees in
       contrast to gstreamer or ROS/ROS2.

   - **Unikernel Linux**: Hacked Linux to dynamically link applications to
     the kernel for performance gains in industrial workloads (e.g., improved
     Redis throughput by 22%)
   - **OPE Gradescope Bridge**: Implemented scalable OpenShift service
     REST API for grading student assignment code in Open Education Framework
   - **OPE Testing**: Automated testing in container build process with GitHub
      Actions shell and Jupyter Notebook tests; reduced container build time by
       70% using mamba
