 * [[https://github.com/rkulskis/rkulskis-assignment-2][Github Link]]
** Assignment 3: MNIST SVD
 * This assignment implements SVD on the MNIST dataset to detect digits
	 [0-9]. We visualize the top 5 singular vectors as 28x28 grayscale images
	 for each differing number of components and draw conclusions about the
	 feature extraction.
